# Management Company

A management company is responsible for managing services, including roads and green spaces, on new build developments.

> Once the last plot has been sold the management company will be in the control of the house owners and they can mutually agree to change the arrangements.

> The Management Company will become the owner of the communal open spaces once all the plots have been sold. The Management Company’s expenses will be recovered by the service charge as detailed in the TP1.

> Upon completion of the sale of the last property at the Estate, the Transferor shall transfer the Retained Land to the Management Company for a consideration in the sum of £1.00.
