# Management Company

A management company is responsible for managing services, including roads and green spaces, on new build developments.

Under Section B 14 of the GENERAL INFORMATION AND SITE INFORMATION BOOKLET:

> Once the last plot has been sold the management company will be in the control of the house owners and they can mutually agree to change the arrangements.

Under Section C 3.3:

> The Management Company will become the owner of the communal open spaces once all the plots have been sold. The Management Company’s expenses will be recovered by the service charge as detailed in the TP1.

In Section 12.7.3 of the TP1 submitted to the Land Registry, it states in respect of the Management Company, that the Transferor covenants:

> Upon completion of the sale of the last property at the Estate, the Transferor shall transfer the Retained Land to the Management Company for a consideration in the sum of £1.00.

## Restrictive Covenants

During the conveyancing process, your solicitor will check to see that the relevant covenants are recorded on the land charges register. And, look at the wording of a covenant to ensure that it is correctly drawn up and therefore enforceable.

Having established likelihood of enforceability, a conveyancer will usually look for options where insurance can be obtained to cover the liability of any further breach of contract. Including any possible damages or compensation, alteration costs, reduction in value of the property as well as legal expenses incurred.
