# Management Company

Once the last plot has been sold the management company will be in the control of the house owners and they can mutually agree to change the arrangements.

The Management Company will become the owner of the communal open spaces once all the plots have been sold. The Management Companyâ€™s expenses will be recovered by the service charge as detailed in the TP1.
