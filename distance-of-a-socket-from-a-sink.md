## Legislation 

> Building regulations in the United Kingdom are statutory instruments or statutory regulations that seek to ensure that the policies set out in the relevant legislation are carried out. Building regulations approval is required for most building work in the UK.

> The Building Regulations may apply in and around buildings. These requirements are
intended to protect people’s safety, health and welfare. They also set standards for
accessibility, water use, energy use and security. The approved documents give further
guidance for many common building situations. They contain statutory guidance on how to
meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
>
> Where the approved documents do not provide appropriate guidance, there may be other ways to demonstrate compliance. It may be possible to achieve compliance by following the advice in one or more of the sources set out below:
> 
> a. guidance from recognised standards bodies
> 
> b. industry recognised codes
>
> c. manufacturers’ technical literature.

> Part P forms part of the Building Regulations. The principle of the Building Regulations is to ensure that consistent standards are applied to the construction of buildings including its structure, fire safety, sound insulation, drainage, ventilation and electrical safety.
>
> In short, electrical installations must be safe!  Part P of the Building Regulations applies to fixed electrical installations in dwellings (including gardens and shared amenities in blocks of flats, and any building that shares its electricity supply with a dwelling).

### What is their guidance?

> #### Question
> How far should an electrical accessory be located from a gas or electric cooker, hob, kitchen sink, or wash basin?
> 
> #### Considerations
> In BS 6172 ‘Specification for installation, servicing and maintenance of domestic gas cooking appliances’ says ‘the cable, plug, socket, switched fused spur, double pole switch or control unit shall not be in contact with hot surfaces or directly exposed to products of combustion’.
> 
> In Electrical Safety First ‘Wiring Regulations Advisory Group’ have considered this matter and have given their interpretation of BS 7671 ‘Requirements for electrical installations’ in their frequently asked questions and answers on their website.
> 
> #### Answer
> In the absence of any advice in the appliance manufacturer’s installation instructions, an electrical accessory such as a socket outlet, switch, control unit, consumer unit etc. should be positioned to enable safe operation and to avoid the harmful effects of heat and steam from cooking activities or splashing from use of a sink or wash basin.
> 
> A minimum distance of 100mm, measured horizontally from an electrical accessory to the edge of a freestanding cooker or individual hob (see diagram 2) is considered acceptable for the purposes of avoiding adverse effects from using a cooker or hob. An electrical accessory should not be located immediately above a cooker or hob due to the possibility of people reaching over suffering burns, or the flexible cable of connected equipment being damaged.
> 
> A minimum distance of 300mm, measured horizontally from an electrical accessory and/or consumer unit or distribution board to the edge of the bowl of a sink (see diagram 3) or wash basin opening (see diagram 1) is considered acceptable for the purposes of avoiding splashing from using a sink, or wash basin.
> 
> General guidance is to avoid positioning a consumer unit immediately above or alongside a sink and where space exists an accessory should be located beyond a drainer.

## NICEIC

### Who are the NICEIC?

> The National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC) is one of several organisations which regulates the training and work of electrical enterprises in the UK. The NICEIC is one of several providers given Government approval to offer Competent Person Schemes to oversee electrical work within the electrical industry.

* Source: [NICEIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Inspection_Council_for_Electrical_Installation_Contracting), Wikipedia

### What is their guidance?

> Electrical sockets or switches should be fitted at a safe distance (it is recommended at least 30cm horizontally) from a sink to avoid the chance of water coming into contact with electricity.
> 
>Sockets should also be easily accessible. If appliances such as fridges, dishwashers and washing machines are fitted under worktops, getting to sockets may be difficult. Ideally, these appliances should be controlled by a switched fuse connection unit mounted above the worktop where you can reach it easily.
>
>All new sockets in a house require protection by an RCD (Residual Current Device).
>
>An RCD is a sensitive safety device that switches off electricity automatically if there is a fault. It is a life-saving device designed to protect against the risks of electrocution and fire caused by earth faults.

## IET

### Who are the IET?

> The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) is a multidisciplinary professional engineering institution. The IET was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions: the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), dating back to 1871, and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) dating back to 1884. Its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 158,000 in 153 countries. The IET's main offices are in Savoy Place in London, England and at Michael Faraday House in Stevenage, England.
> 
> In the United Kingdom, the IET has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician, as a licensed member institution of the Engineering Council.
>
> It was well-known for publication of the IEE Wiring Regulations which now continue to be written by the IET and to be published by the British Standards Institution as BS 7671.

### What is the relevance of the IET?

> British Standard BS 7671 "Requirements for Electrical Installations. IET Wiring Regulations", informally called in the electrical community The "Regs", is the national standard in the United Kingdom for electrical installation and the safety of electrical wiring in domestic, commercial, industrial, and other buildings, also in special installations and locations, such as marinas or caravan parks and medical locations.

* Source: [BS 7671](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_7671), Wikipedia

### What does BS 7671 say?

> 512.2 External influences
>
> 512.2.1 Equipment shall be of a design appropriate to the situation in which it is to be used or its mode of installation shall take account of the conditions likely to be encountered.
>
> 512.2.2 If the equipment does not, by its construction, have the characteristics relevant to the external influences of its location, it may nevertheless be used on condition that it is provided with appropriate additional protection in the erection of the installation. Such protection shall not adversely affect the operation of the equipment thus protected.
>
> 512.2.3 Where different external influences occur simultaneously, they may have independent or mutual effects and the degree of protection shall be provided accordingly.
