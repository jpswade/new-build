# Hollow sounding tiles

> Hollow sounds produced by tapping tiles can also be a result of an improper installation method called spot-bonding. Spot-bonding is when an installer applies “spots” of adhesive on each corner of a tile and one in the center, and then presses it into place.

> A tile having a hollow sound could be an indication that there is a void under those hollow sounding spots and/or the tile isn't bonded at those hollow sounding spots.  A hollow sound can be caused by the configuration of the tile assembly, it could be the result of having some sort of membrane under the tile.  It could be an indication that the underlying substrate has a condition that is causing the hollow sound.  The only way to determine what is causing the hollow sound is to carefully remove the tile and evaluate the underlying conditions.
