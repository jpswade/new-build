## Rainwater Downpipe

If the fitting at the base of the rainwater pipe is diverting water away from the drain or gulley then it will need to be corrected.

This is a breach of building regulations and should be taken very seriously.

> Regarding the fitting at the base of the rainwater pipe we would suggest that if this is diverting water away from the gulley then it should be removed.

### Building Regulations

> The Building Regulations part H, Drainage and water disposal, requires that adequate provision is made for rainwater to be carried from the roof of buildings. Approved document H suggests that to achieve this, roofs should be designed with a suitable fall towards either a surface water collection channel or gutter that surface water to vertical rainwater downpipes, which in turn connect the discharge to the drainage system.

> The discharge from a downpipe can be:
> - Directly connected to a drain discharging into a soakaway.
> - Directly connected to a drain discharging into a surface water sewer.
> - Indirectly connected to a drain via a trapped gully if the drain discharges into a combined sewer.
