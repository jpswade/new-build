# Cold Room

>A cold room is a sign that the walls have not been sealed properly. Meaning cold air can get in and funnels up towards the roof. This is a breach of building regulations and should be taken seriously.
>
>Walls not being sealed properly are also a potential fire risk due to the gaps not being airtight. Therefore, flames can easily travel through the walls of the house endangering the lives of the people in the house.
