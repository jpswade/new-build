# Cold Room

>A cold room is a sign that the walls have not been sealed properly. Meaning cold air can get in and funnels up towards the roof. This is a breach of building regulations and should be taken seriously.
>
>Walls not being sealed properly are also a potential fire risk due to the gaps not being airtight. Therefore, flames can easily travel through the walls of the house endangering the lives of the people in the house.

# Cavity

Approved document B, Fire Safety, Volume 2, Buildings other than dwellinghouses (2019 edition), defines a cavity as:

A space enclosed by elements of a building (including a suspended ceiling) or contained within an element, but that is not a room, cupboard, circulation space, protected shaft, or space within a flue, chute, duct, pipe or conduit.

And a cavity barrier as:

A construction within a cavity, other than a smoke curtain, to perform either of the following functions.

Close a cavity to stop smoke or flame entering.
Restrict the movement of smoke or flame within a cavity.

# Cavity Barrier

> A concealed space (cavity) in the external wall of a building can act as a chimney and provide an easy route for flame, hot gases and smoke to propagate from one compartment of a building to another. Unsealed cavities can allow air to be drawn in and smoke to vent out, enabling the fire spread to accelerate through the façade. This chimney effect enables flames that are within a cavity to be able to extend between 5 and 10 times higher than a flame that is not within a cavity, regardless of whether or not the surfaces of the cavity are combustible.

> Regulation and [BS 9991](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/BS_9991:2015_Fire_safety_in_the_design,_management_and_use_of_residential_buildings._Code_of_practice) require that the flame spread over or within an external wall construction should be controlled to avoid creating a route for rapid fire spread bypassing compartment floors or walls. This is an important consideration for any fire strategy but is of fundamental importance when a ‘stay put’ strategy is in place.
