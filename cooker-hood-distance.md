Neff states:

> It is important to pay attention to the correct height of the hood. A distance of 45cm should not be exceeded. Electric cooktops require a distance of between 45 and 65cm, depending on the type of extractor hood. For gas hobs, a distance or height of 65cm is the minimum distance to the extractor hood. The distance for ceiling hoods is 120cm.
