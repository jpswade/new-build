# Lawn

> A newly laid turf lawn will need some tender loving care throughout its first season, especially during the summer months. For best results, water your lawn during the coolest times of the day. Try not to walk on the lawn until the turf is established and the ground is firm. In soft landscaping, such as lawn areas, settlement of the ground may occur and should be made good as part of normal maintenance.
> 
> Any issues that arise with your lawn should be addressed directly with your developer,as your home structural warranty does not cover this feature.
