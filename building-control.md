## Building Control

> The building regulations require that a project's compliance is independently verified. Building control bodies (BCBs) are responsible for checking building work to verify it complies with the regulations. This includes new buildings, alterations, installations and extensions. Historically, this verification could only be carried out by local authorities, however, it can now also be provided by privately appointed approved inspectors.

> The role of Building Control is to audit and verify construction and to that end we donâ€™t specifically oversee every aspect of construction.

> [The Builder] has "the prime responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations and therefore we would suggest that you maintain contact with them over the remaining warranty period"
