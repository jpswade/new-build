## Photography

### Legal restrictions on photography

> In the United Kingdom there are no laws forbidding photography of private property from a public place. ... Civil proceeding can be taken if a person is filmed without consent, and privacy laws exist to protect a person where they can expect privacy.

### Use of drones

The policy is to contact the Police first as they often have greater resources, response times and powers of investigation than the CAA.

To support this, the CAA has now agreed with the Police, in a signed Memorandum of Understanding that the Police will take the lead in dealing with unmanned aircraft misuse incidents, particularly at public events, that may contravene aviation safety legislation or other relevant criminal legislation.

The CAA’s remit is limited to safety and does not include concerns over privacy or broadcast rights.

Privacy issues are covered by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) and will not be dealt with by the CAA.
