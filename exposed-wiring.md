# Exposed Wiring

> A Code 1 (C1) observation means 'Danger present. Risk of injury. Immediate remedial action required.'
> 
> A C1 represents an immediate threat to the safety of your employees, customers or guests and should be rectified or made safe as soon as possible.
> 
> An example of a C1 defect would be accessible live conductors due to damage, poorly modified enclosures or removed maintenance panels. Incorrect polarity would also attract a code C1 as it may allow conductive parts, not normally expected to be live, to become live.
