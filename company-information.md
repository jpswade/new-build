# Company Information

## Displaying your Company Registration Information

>Since 2007, the Companies Act has stated that registered companies must display certain information on their website and in their emails or they will be in breach of the act.
> 
> Not doing so will mean you risk a fine.
> 
> ### If you are a registered company, you should be aware that you need to display the following:
> 
> * name, geographic address and email address of the service provider. The name of the organisation with which the customer is contracting must be given. This might differ from the trading name. Any such difference should be explained as “ABC.com is the trading name of ABC Enterprises Limited”
> * the registration number and the place of registration should be stated (e.g. “ABC Enterprises Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1234567”)
> * if your business is a member of a trade or professional association, membership details, including any registration number, should be provided
> * if you have a VAT number, it should be stated – even if your website is not being used for e-commerce transactions
> * it is not sufficient to include a ‘contact us’ form without also providing an email address and geographic address.

## Gas Safe Register Logo Usage

Businesses that are not currently Gas Safe Registered ... will be written requesting that they take immediate steps to remove the registered trademarks from their website and any other advertising material.

They will be advised that failure to do this will result in Gas Safe Register passing their details on to Trading Standards for their consideration of a possible offence under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.

> Gas Safe Register is the official gas registration body for the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Guernsey, appointed by the relevant Health and Safety Authority for each area. By law all gas engineers must be on the Gas Safe Register.

## Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008

> Under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (CPRs), property vendors are obliged to declare any information that can decrease the value of the property or affect its enjoyment.

> The CPRs prohibit misleading actions that cause or are likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision they would not have taken otherwise. The definition of a 'misleading action' is very detailed (regulation 5 of the CPRs) but it essentially means providing false information or giving an overall presentation that deceives or is likely to deceive the consumer, even if the information is factually correct.
